    <h1>What is the most influential book or blog post you've read regarding front-end development</h1>
    <p>
      The most influential blog post I've read about front-end development
      is a post about achieving a better way to learn and to teach code.
      The author tears into Khan Academy's method of telling students to jump
      into the code and see what happens! He suggests a language that allows
      programmers to see their actions in real time, and compares coding to an
      art. "The programmer does not create because he can't see what he's doing
      but creates inspite of the fact that he cannot see. This is a testament
      to the power of the desire to create. But we should not be satisfied by this
      but rather work to facilitate the power to create through code and make
      it as accessable as possible for all people." -I paraphrase as my memory serves.
      This article moved me and as I learn to code I keep his comments in my mind.
      It is my desire to find a better way to teach new programmers, and to one day
      create a language that will enable adults to create object oriented programs
      that offer real-time insights.
      <h1>If you could master one technology this year, what would it be?</h1>
      <p>
        There are so many technologies to master. It's really hard to narrow down to one
        because I have so much to learn, and suspect I always will, but I'd like to master
        JavaScript. That's so basic. But it's fundamental to everything else that I'm interested in.
        Things like typescript and Angular 1.x and 2, Service Workers or Web Components.
        Mastering JavaScript is a key that opens doors everywhere I look.

      <h1>Describe any front-end application framework. How does it work? What are the upsides and downsides?</h1>
      <p>
        I recently used knockoutJS and the model-view-viewmodel to create a scalable single-page application
        that pulled JSON responses from FourSquare and rendered information into a Google Maps page. The MVVM
        framework of knockoutJS works like a telephone system. All lines are connected to a central hub that
        communicates with each end. No model or view speaks directly one to the other. All connections go through the
        viewmodel. This allows apps to scale up and avoids spaghetti code. The MVVM worked by calling data-bind in the view (html).
        This activates the model (javascript) and works the "magic" on the monitor.

      <h1>Write a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a memorized version of that function.
          A memorized version of a function caches and returns the results of its call so that when it is called again
          with the same input, it doesn't run
          its computation but instead returns the results from cache.</h1>
      <p>
        That's a mouth full. Memoizing is using a function in a function to help a program remember past calculations.
        This frees memory for the computer so it doesn't have to repeat the same calculations several times over.
        This is a completely new concept (outside of recursion) for me, so sorry evaluators, I had to read up on this
        from about six different blogs.

      <!--
      <script>
        foo = function (x) {
          console.log("calculating!");
          memoize(foo);
          return x + 5;
        }

        var memoizedFoo = memoize(foo);

        memoizedFoo(5);

        memoizedFoo(5);

        memoizedFoo(10);
      </script>
    -->

      <script>
        var counter = 0;
        function cowCounter() {
          if (true) {
            counter += 1;
            document.getElementById('cow').innerHTML = counter;
          }
        }

    <h1>In one year where do you hope to be?</h1>
    <p>
      In one year I hope to be a confident junior developer.
      I hope to be a team member coworkers trust and value as part of the team.
      I hope to be in a position to help newer developers, and be confident
      in my work so that I can help new hires feel welcome during the on boarding
      process.
